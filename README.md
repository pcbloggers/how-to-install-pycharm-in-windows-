<h4><strong>What is an IDE ?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Python is a common cross-platform open-source programming language that is used by many applications and websites due to its high performance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Since Python is both cross-platform and open-source, we can build our code without incurring extra costs or duplicating work if we target many operating systems. Pinterest and Instagram are two examples of Python-powered apps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4><strong>Why Do We Use PyCharm as an IDE ?</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Developers can code without the use of an IDE such as PyCharm. All that is truly need is a program like notepad++, Geany, or TextPad. The downside of using a non-IDE-based program is the additional work require to remember different functionalities in each language, as well as the loss of effectiveness and debugging capabilities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are just a few of the benefits you get from an IDE like PyCharm:&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Auto-code generation</li><li>Code autocompletion capabilities</li><li>Refraction functionality</li><li>Compile and Build along with organic unit testing</li><li>Integrated debugging tools</li><li>Improved source control</li><li>Better overall&nbsp;project management&nbsp;tools</li><li>Increased standards enforcement that may be company or project specific</li><li>Improved resource organization, and addition of shortcuts that reduce effort and time spent on code</li></ul>
